## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **AI Content Quality**: Implement human review workflow before publishing
2. **Payment Security**: Use Stripe's secure components and test thoroughly
3. **Data Migration**: Create backup and rollback procedures
4. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize database queries early

### Contingency Plans
- **AI Integration Delays**: Fall back to manual content creation
- **Payment Issues**: Implement offline enrollment with manual verification
- **Performance Problems**: Scale Firebase resources or implement caching
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and updates
